# Python-project-Medicine-Scenario
Analyzing the diabetes dataset to derive meaningful insights about disease management and outcomes.

Project Overview:

Dr. Zeus has collected data from 1000 diabetic patients over a year, focusing on how they manage their condition. The dataset includes:

Duration of diabetes ('Kolku dolgo e dijabeticar')<br>
Quarterly hemoglobin A1C levels ('Kolku mu e tromesechen (hemoglobin A1C) she4er')<br>
Medication type (insulin or tablets) ('Dali e na insulin ili na tabli?')<br>
Current blood glucose level ('Glukoza (momentalna) vo krv')<br>
Presence of diabetic retinopathy ('Dali ima dijabetesna retinopatija?')<br>

Tasks:

Data Cleaning:

Rename columns.
Handle missing values appropriately.
Highest Glucose Level:

Identify the patient with the highest current glucose level.
Plot all patients' glucose levels and analyze the distribution.
Hemoglobin A1C Analysis:

Calculate average hemoglobin A1C levels per disease duration.
Identify the duration with the highest average glucose levels.
Plot and describe the data.
Medication Comparison:

Compare the average duration of diabetes for patients on insulin vs. tablets.
Determine which treatment method shows better results.
A1C Level Grouping:

Group patients by normal (below 5.7) and elevated A1C levels.
Plot data based on the length of disease for both groups.
Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis:

Analyze the correlation between diabetic retinopathy and other factors.
Separate patients into groups based on the presence of retinopathy and examine characteristics.
Use plots to support analysis.
